# Engaugeus

An experimental application that is built around the idea of increasing engagement of a news website's readership by creating a chatroom based off of the simple idea of whether they agree or disagree with an article.

## About the Project

This is the second semester major project designed to challenge us to think beyond the idea of a two sided marketplace. It's focus is to help us integrate what we have learnt in the previous 4 weeks while doing something different.

The guiding aim of this project was to impress one of the three following people:
  1. Barack Obama (politics)
  2. Rupert Murdoch (journalism)
  3. Bill & Melinda Gates (social causes/global development)
